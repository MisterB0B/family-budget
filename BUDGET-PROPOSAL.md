### THE PROBLEM

| | Amount |
|--|--------|
| Monthly Income | $10,807 |
| Current Spending | ~$10,400 |
| **Surplus/Deficit** | **~$400** |

You're basically breaking even with ZERO margin for error. One bad month and you're negative.

### PROPOSED BUDGET

| | Amount |
|--|--------|
| Monthly Income | $10,807 |
| Fixed Costs | $2,015 |
| Debt Payments | $3,068 |
| Variable Costs | $2,150 |
| **TOTAL EXPENSES** | **$7,233** |
| **MONTHLY SURPLUS** | **$3,574** |

Use surplus for:
- Emergency fund: $500/mo until $5K saved
- Extra debt payoff: $2,500/mo (snowball highest interest first)
- Buffer: $574

---

### BIGGEST OPPORTUNITIES

1. **Zelle to Kelly Ansari ($900/mo)** - What is this? If it's not essential, huge savings.

2. **Dining Out ($500 → $300)** - Save $200/mo. Cook more.

3. **Subscriptions ($400 → $250)** - Audit everything. Kill what you don't use weekly.

4. **Debt Consolidation** - You're paying 15-25% interest on multiple cards. Consider:
   - 0% balance transfer card
   - Personal loan at lower rate
   - Debt consolidation

5. **Insurance ($636)** - Shop around. Could save $100-200/mo.

### DEBT PAYOFF PRIORITY (Avalanche Method)

Pay minimums on everything, throw extra at highest interest first:

1. Credit card interest (likely 20-29% APR)
2. Upstart (likely 15-25%)
3. Monterey Financial (??%)
4. Car loan (likely 5-10%)

---

### QUESTIONS I NEED ANSWERED

1. **Does Elle work?** Income not showing.
2. **What is Kelly Ansari payment?** ($450 x2/month)
3. **What is Monterey Financial?** ($560/mo)
4. **What are the interest rates on each debt?**
5. **What's the balance on each debt?** (for payoff timeline)
